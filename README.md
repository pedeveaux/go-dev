### Purpose
This repository is a Go devcontainer setup for VS Code. I use it to set up a Go devlopment environment without installing anythign directly to my machine. It can be easily expanded by adding other services (i.e. web server, database, etc) to the `docker-compose.yaml` file to get an application up and running. 

### System Requirements
This requires Docker and VS Code. It has been developed and used on Apple Silicon Macs although it should work seamlessly with other hardware.
